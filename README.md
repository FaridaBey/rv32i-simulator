# RISC-V Simulator

## Overview

This project is a RISC-V RV32I simulator developed as part of the **CSCE 231: Computer Organization and Assembly Language Programming** course during Spring 2024. The simulator supports a wide range of RISC-V instructions and includes advanced features such as a GUI, multi-format output, and support for compressed and pseudo instructions. The simulator aims to provide an intuitive and interactive platform for users to learn and experiment with RISC-V architecture.

## Features

1. **GUI Application**

   - Intuitive graphical interface built using Java Swing.
   - Users can input assembly programs, view program execution step-by-step, and customize display formats.

2. **Multi-Format Output**

   - Display values in Decimal, Binary, and Hexadecimal formats.

3. **Support for Pseudo Instructions and Directives**

   - Includes five pseudo instructions and three directives for enhanced program compatibility.

4. **Compressed Instructions (RV32IC)**

   - Comprehensive support for the RV32IC instruction set, including compressed instructions.

5. **Integer Multiplication/Division (RV32IM)**

   - Full support for RV32IM instructions to enable complex arithmetic operations.

6. **Predefined Test Programs**

   - Built-in test programs for quick evaluation of simulator capabilities.

## Design Decisions and Assumptions

- **Programming Environment**: Developed using Apache NetBeans for Java development.
- **GUI Framework**: Built with Java Swing to provide a user-friendly interface.
- **Instruction Handling**:
  - Sequential processing of instructions.
  - Error handling for unsupported instructions and invalid operations.
- **Visualization**:
  - Separate displays for data memory and instruction memory.
  - Program counter tracking and progress bar for simulation monitoring.
- **Initialization**: Default settings for assembly code, program counter, and memory ensure a seamless start.
